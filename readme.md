# Overview

The main goal of this repo is to test different cognitive architectures described
- SOAR cognitive architecture
- LIDA (based on Global workspace Theory (GWT))
- schema mechanism (as described in Drescher, Made-up minds: a constructivist approach to artificial intelligence, 1991)

This repo contains test implementations of different parts of mentioned architectures.
